[zim-wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/) was used to create these notes, and is required in order to view the notes properly.
There are 3 notebooks:
1. Introduction to C++ - For beginners
2. Data Structures with C++ - covers basic algorithms also - search, sort
3. Competitive Programming tips in C++
To open a notebook, run the notebook.zim file with zim-wiki.

These notes were created while doing a course from CodingNinjas.com.
I've added many more topics since.
