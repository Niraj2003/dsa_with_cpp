====== 2.1 sets and unordered sets ======
Created Saturday 18 April 2020

* Works the same as hashmap, except the fact that we store only keys, no values.
**Note: **unordered_map cannot work with pair<> out of the box. Either use set or provide a hash function for the pair.
* Use set pair for coordinates and tuples, never use a hashmap.
* Sets do not give error if we try to insert duplicates, as dealing with them is their primary op.
