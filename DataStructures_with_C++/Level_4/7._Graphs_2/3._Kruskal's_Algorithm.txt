====== 3. Kruskal's Algorithm ======
Created Saturday 25 April 2020

Idea:
1. Sort the edges according to weights. **Adjacency list will be better here(as it'll store the weights).** 
2. Take the edges: source-destination-weight as input.
3. For storing the MST, make a list of n-1 <edges>.

**No visited required!**
