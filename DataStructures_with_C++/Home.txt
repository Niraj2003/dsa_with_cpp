=== Note ===
* These are extensive notes made by while doing the "Data Structures with C++" course by Coding Ninjas. Course Duration: 15 weeks.
* I've added some proofs and memory-aids that were not rigorously proved in the course. They are important.
* Many topics have been added by me that were not part of the course, for example - [[6. Algorithm Design]] section, Parts of [[8. C++ Continued]]. 
* If you are a beginner, you can //skip// topics added by me, if you want to finish within 15 weeks. Also, Algorithm design is usually taught as a separate course at most universities. So it may take a significant amount of time.
**Unless stated otherwise, all topics are from the Coding Ninjas course.**
