* We can use helper functions wherever necessary.
* We can use extra arguments in the helper to pass values.
* We **should **use integer declarations if we hope to forward/or backtrack the value to the next, previous stack. This is a thing of experience.
* You get too pedantic in recursion. Use for loops wherever necessary. e.g for shifying the array.
