# 5. Variations of BST
Created Wednesday 12 February 2020

For the best insertion, deletion and other ops for a BST is O(H)
i.e if we can minimize h, then we can minimize the height.

* |H~left ~- H~right~| <= 1 for all nodes.
* h = O(log(n))
* Search, insertion and deletion is O(h).


Types of balanced BSTs:

1. AVL tree - Read and implement.
2. Red-Black Tree
3. 2-4 tree
