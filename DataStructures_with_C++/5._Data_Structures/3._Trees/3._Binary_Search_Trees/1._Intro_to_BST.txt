====== 1. Intro to BST ======
Created Thursday 08 April 2021

* The simplest definition: A binary tree where all the nodes in the left **subtree** are smaller than the root and all the nodes on **right subtree** are greater than the root. i.e the root specifies the max for the left subtree, and min for the right subtree. This is true for all nodes.
* We can use **duplicates too**, but make sure that the equality is decided for left or for right subtree(but not both).
* The subtree is very important. Merely having root->left->data < root->data && root->right->data > root->data is **wrong, **as it does not talk about the whole tree. Root decides the min and max for right and left respectively.
