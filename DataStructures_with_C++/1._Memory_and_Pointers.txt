====== 1. Memory and Pointers ======
Created Thursday 08 April 2021

=== Note ===
The course had two small topics after "[[+2. Dynamic Memory Allocation|Dynamic Memory Allocation]]":
1. [[7. C++ Continued:1. Macros and Global Variables|Macros and Global Variables]]
2. [[7. C++ Continued:2. Inline and Default Arguments|Inline and Default Arguments]]
I've moved them elsewhere. They are very important(and easy) in general, but are not required for coding data structures.
