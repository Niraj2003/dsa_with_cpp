# 3. Inheritance:Syntax
Created Sunday 26 April 2020

**Syntax for inheritance** - Use ``:`` symbol.
	class Camera{ /*code*/ };
	class Telephone{ /*code*/ };
	
	class Smartphone : private Camera, private Telephone
	{ /*code*/ };


* There's no limit to the number of base(aka parent classes).
* Access specifiers are used to designate access level for inherited members from parent classes.
* Inheritance access controls follows a simple rule - accessibility cannot be increased.

* This is valid for generations of any length.
* Defaults access specifier is ``private``, i.e if not specified.
* : is just 'from' in inheritance

### Selective Inheritance
What if we want to inherit as ``public``, but keep some inherited members ``private``? 
C++ allows selective inheritance. Just use the ``using`` keyword.
Example
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;
	
	class A
	{
		public:
	    	void f(){}
	    	void g();
	    	void h();
	};
	
	// we want to inhertic h as public, rest as private
	
	class B : private A
	{
		public:
	    	using A::f; // tagged as public
	    	void f()
	    	{
	        	cout << "B::f called\n";
	    	}
	};
	
	int main()
	{
	    B obj;
	    obj.f(); // OK
	}
