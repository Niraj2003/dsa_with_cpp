====== 1. Inheritance - Concept ======
Created Sunday 26 April 2020

**What is inheritance**: Inheritance is a code reuse mechanism in OOP. It is used to avoid redundant code.

* In OOPS, we may want to use inheritance to allow for general things, e.g vehicles. All have medium(of travel), speed and color. **Obviously different vehicles have their own characteristics as well.**

* Inheritance helps us achieve code reuse.

**Access Specifier are important in Inheritance**
Private: Nobody except the class can access it, not even the derived classes. 
Public: Anybody can access these members.
Protected: Only child classes can access these members.
