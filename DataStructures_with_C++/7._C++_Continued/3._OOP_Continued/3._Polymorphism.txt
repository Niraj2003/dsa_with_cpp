====== 3. Polymorphism ======
Created Monday 27 April 2020

* Literally means many forms.
* We the concept of polymorphism to make our code dynamic(i.e context dependent behavior), this decreases the switch cases or huge if else ladders.

It is of two types:
1. Compile Time: The //form// is decided at compile time.
2. Run Time: We decide the //form// at run-time.
**form **here refers to the chosen behavior.
