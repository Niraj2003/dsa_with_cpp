# 1. Has Path
Created Tuesday 31 March 2020

Given node A and node B. Check if A and B have a path between them.

* Run BFS/DFS starting from A and return true if B is found. If not return false.
* No case of connectedness here., coz the answer is false if A and B are in disjoint groups, automatically.
